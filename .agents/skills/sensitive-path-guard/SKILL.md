  Add and maintain a git tracked-path blocklist script
  (scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh): blocked/allowed regexes, CI wiring,
  allowlist exceptions, and failure triage. Use when blocking .env, bak/,
  dumps, credential JSON, or people spreadsheets from entering git, or when

# Sensitive Path Guard

Fail CI (and local checks) when **git-tracked paths** look like secrets, local
backups, or people-data dumps. This guards **path names / locations**, not file
contents — pair with [`gitleaks-guard`](../gitleaks-guard/SKILL.md) for content
secrets and [`sensitive-data-git`](../sensitive-data-git/SKILL.md) for policy and
anonymized fixtures.

Private-dir block patterns are **stack-agnostic defaults** (Laravel
`storage/app/private/`, plus generic `storage/private/`, `var/private/`,
`.data/private/`). Align them with the path documented in the repo `AGENTS.md`.

## When this skill applies

- Adding `scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh` to a repo
- Extending blocked/allowed path regexes
- Wiring the script into a CI `sensitive-data` job
- Triaging “BLOCKED tracked path” failures
- Reviewing PRs that `git add -f` storage or dump files

## Core rules

1. **Scan tracked paths only** — `git ls-files` (what would ship), not the whole
   working tree of gitignored storage.
2. **Deny by default for known bad shapes** — `.env*` (except `.env.example`),
   `bak/`, `*.sql`/`*.dump`, credential JSON, people spreadsheets under tracked
   trees.
3. **Allowlist narrowly** — only anonymized stubs / reference masters that must
   live in git.
4. **Never weaken** the script to land a dump “just this once”.
5. **Do not `git add -f`** gitignored private storage.
6. On failure: move the file to gitignored storage (or delete), unstage, fix
   `.gitignore` if needed, re-run.

## Guard triad

| Guard | Catches |
|---|---|
| This skill (path script) | Tracked dumps, `.env`, `bak/`, credential filenames |
| `gitleaks-guard` | Secret **content** in any tracked file |
| `sensitive-data-git` | Policy: where to store data, anonymize fixtures, log redaction |

## Install the script

1. Copy [`scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh`](scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh) to
   the target repo as `scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh`
2. `chmod +x scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh`
3. Adapt `blocked_regexes` / `allowed_regexes` to the product (see
   [templates.md](templates.md))
4. Wire CI + document in `AGENTS.md`

### Local run

```bash
bash scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh
```

Expect either `Sensitive-path check passed.` or a list of `BLOCKED tracked path:`
lines and exit code `1`.

## Designing regexes

**Blocked (baseline in the starter script — domain-agnostic):**

- `.env*` (except allowlisted `.env.example`), `bak/`, `*.sql` / `*.dump` / `*.backup`
- Tabular dumps under `data/`, `exports/`, `imports/`, `uploads/`
- Credential/key material (`credentials*.json`, `*.pem`/`*.p12`, `id_rsa`, kubeconfig, `*.tfstate`)
- Private storage dirs (`storage/app/private/`, `storage|var|.data/private/`, `secrets/`)
- Ops artifacts (`.har`, deploy/ci logs, heap/core dumps)

**Allowed (examples):**

- `(^|/)\.env\.example$`
- named anonymized stubs (`data/reference_stub\.json$`, geo masters, etc.)
- fictional test fixtures under `tests/Fixtures/`

For *what* counts as sensitive content (not just paths), see
[`sensitive-data-git/sensitive-catalog.md`](../sensitive-data-git/sensitive-catalog.md).

Prefer **named** allow entries over broad globs. Document each new allow in the
PR.

## Agent checklist

When adding or changing the path guard:

- [ ] Script lives at `scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh` and is executable
- [ ] Baseline blocked patterns present
- [ ] Allowlist only for intentional non-secret tracked files
- [ ] CI runs the script before or beside gitleaks
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` points humans/agents at the script
- [ ] No real people files remain tracked

## Failure triage

See [examples.md](examples.md). Short version:

1. Read the blocked path + matched regex
2. If real sensitive file → untrack, move to gitignored storage, keep out of git
3. If intentional anonymized stub → add a **narrow** allowed regex
4. Re-run the script; do not skip CI

## Install into a repo

**Portable core:**

1. Copy [`scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh`](scripts/check-sensitive-paths.sh)
2. Adapt regexes; document in `AGENTS.md` (see [templates.md](templates.md))
3. Wire the script into CI beside gitleaks

**Cursor / Copilot:** same script + CI; optionally also expose this skill via
`.cursor/skills/` or Copilot instructions. Other agents keep using `AGENTS.md`.
See root [README.md](../README.md).
